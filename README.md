# ProjectManagement
Project Management Case Studies with Machine Learning and AI
**Overview**
This repository contains Python code for various use cases in project management, specifically in the real estate domain. The project demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to enhance different aspects of project management, including strategic planning, design and construction management, budget and schedule control, risk management, sustainability, technology integration, and change management.

**Summary**
The project focuses on the integration of advanced technologies like ML, DL, and AI into real estate project management to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and achieve better project outcomes. Each use case is implemented using Python and various ML/AI models to address specific challenges in project management.
